    <!--
        Use HTML, CSS, & JS to create a simple game of rock paper scissors against a computer.
        Try not to use any tutorials that give you an answer.
        Use any of thre resources I have provided to the class! (MDN, W3Schools, etc.)
        It doen't need to look good, just work!
        Contain all your HTML within this file.
        Contain all your CSS in a single file.
        You have more freedom with your JS. Just stay within your limits.
        If you put "//" at the start of the line it will strike it thorugh indicating complete.

        Your game must then allow user input for a choice;
        Your game must then determine a winner;
        Your game must display a winner;
        Your game must have animations;
        :::     END    :::
        Looking nice is priority number 2.
        Animations are priority number 3.
