        Use HTML, CSS, & JS to create a simple game of simon.
        Try not to use any tutorials that give you an answer.
        Use any of thre resources I have provided to the class! (MDN, W3Schools, etc.)
        It doen't need to look good, just work!
        Contain all your HTML within this file.
        Contain all your CSS in a single file.
        You have more freedom with your JS. Just stay within your limits.
        If you put "//" at the start of the line it will strike it thorugh indicating complete.

        :::REQUIREMENTS:::
        Your game must have 4 seperate "buttons" with different colors and symbols;
        Your game must start with a pattern of length 1 and increment the length each time a correct sequence is entered.
        Your game must display the pattern each time it adds to it.
        Your game must indicate to the player when they have completed the current sequence before the new sequence begins.
        Your game must not let the player interact while the new sequence is being displayed.
        Your game should not have a fixed pattern, it should be randomly created by your game.
