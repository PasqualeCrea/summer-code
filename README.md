# Summer-Code
Some small projects to keep you sharp over summer break.

All projects are contained in sub-directories of the "projects" directory.

There are 5 options for the assignment, you are permitted to complete as many or as few as you would like.

All 5 options 100% have tutorials online you could copy and paste. *DO NOT DO THAT!* The point is to try something new and difficult.

Specific instructions and requirements are contained within each project's index.html file.  All options are difficult for new coders, but not impossible. The number in parentheses represents the difficulty on a scale of one to five (five being the most difficult).
